 r21buddy
==========

A pure Python version of the Ogg length hack for In The Groove 2 R21.

Currently this is a command line only program.  See --help for
details.  Drag-and-drop might work on Windows, but I am not certain.

Usage
=====

Linux users: just run this script as-is.  Requires Python 2.7, or
Python 2.6 with the argparse library.

Windows users: Get Python 2.7 and you can run this directly.
Alternatively, compile a .exe using py2exe, pyinstaller or another
similar tool.  (I plan to eventually offer .exes myself; just haven't
got to it yet.)
